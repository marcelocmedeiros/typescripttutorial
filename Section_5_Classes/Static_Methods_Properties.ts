// Unlike an instance property, a static property is shared among all instances of a class.

// To declare a static property, you use the static keyword. To access a static property, you use the className.propertyName syntax. For example:

class Employee {
    static headcount: number = 0;

    constructor(
        private firstName: string,
        private lastName: string,
        private jobTitle: string) {

        Employee.headcount++;
    }
}

// In this example, the headcount is a static property that is initialized to zero. Its value is increased by 1 whenever a new object is created.

// The following creates two Employee objects and shows the value of the headcount property. It returns two as expected.

let john = new Employee('John', 'Doe', 'Front-end Developer');
let jane = new Employee('Jane', 'Doe', 'Back-end Developer');

console.log(Employee.headcount); // 2

// Static methods
// Similar to the static property, a static method is also shared across instances of the class. To declare a static method, you use the static keyword before the method name. For example:

class Employee {
    private static headcount: number = 0;

    constructor(
        private firstName: string,
        private lastName: string,
        private jobTitle: string) {

        Employee.headcount++;
    }

    public static getHeadcount() {
        return Employee.headcount;
    }
}

// In this example:

// First, change the access modifier of the headcount static property from public to private so that its value cannot be changed outside of the class without creating a new Employee object.
// Second, add the getHeadcount() static method that returns the value of the headcount static property.
// To call a static method, you use the className.staticMethod() syntax. For example:

let john = new Employee('John', 'Doe', 'Front-end Developer');
let jane = new Employee('Jane', 'Doe', 'Back-end Developer');

console.log(Employee.getHeadcount); // 2

// In practice, you will find a library that contains many static properties and methods like the Math object. It has PI, E, â€¦ static properties and abs(), round(), etc., static methods.

// Static properties and methods are shared by all instances of a class.
// Use the static keyword before a property or a method to make it static.
