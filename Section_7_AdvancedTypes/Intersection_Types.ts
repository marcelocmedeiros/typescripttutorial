// An intersection type creates a new type by combining multiple existing types. The new type has all features of the existing types.

// To combine types, you use the & operator as follows:

type typeAB = typeA & typeB;

// The typeAB will have all properties from both typeA and typeB.

// Note that the union type uses the | operator that defines a variable that can hold a value of either typeA or typeB

let varName = typeA | typeB; // union type

// Suppose that you have three interfaces: BusinessPartner, Identity, and Contact.

interface BusinessPartner {
    name: string;
    credit: number;
}

interface Identity {
    id: number;
    name: string;
}

interface Contact {
    email: string;
    phone: string;
}

// The following defines two intersection types:

type Employee = Identity & Contact;
type Customer = BusinessPartner & Contact;

// The Employee type contains all properties of the Identity and Contact type:

type Employee = Identity & Contact;

let e: Employee = {
    id: 100,
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john.doe@example.com',
    phone: '(408)-897-5684'
};

// And the Customer type contains all properties of the BusinessPartner and Contact type:

type Customer = BusinessPartner & Contact;

let c: Customer = {
    name: 'ABC Inc.',
    credit: 1000000,
    email: 'sales@abcinc.com',
    phone: '(408)-897-5735'
};

// Later, if you want to implement employee sales, you can create a new intersection type that contains all properties of Identity, Contact, and BusinessPartner types:

type Employee = Identity & BusinessPartner & Contact;

let e: Employee = {
    id: 100,
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john.doe@example.com',
    phone: '(408)-897-5684',
    credit: 1000
};

// Notice both BusinessPartner and Identity have the property name with the same type. If they do not, then you will have an error.

// Type Order
// When you intersect types, the order of the types doesnâ€™t matter. For example:

type typeAB = typeA & typeB;
type typeBA = typeB & typeA;

// In this example, typeAB and typeBA have the same properties.

// Summary
// An intersection type combines two or more types to create a new type that has all properties of the existing types.
// The type order is not important when you combine types.
