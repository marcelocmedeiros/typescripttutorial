// The void type denotes the absence of having any type at all. It is a little like the opposite of the any type.

// Typically, you use the void type as the return type of functions that do not return a value. For example:

function log(message): void {
    console.log(messsage);
}

// It is a good practice to add the void type as the return type of a function or a method that doesnâ€™t return any value. By doing this, you can gain the following benefits:

// Improve clarity of the code: you do not have to read the whole function body to see if it returns anything.
// Ensure type-safe: you will never assign the function with the void return type to a variable.
// Notice that if you use the void type for a variable, you can only assign undefined to that variable. In this case, the void type is not useful. For example:

let useless: void = undefined;
useless = 1; // error

// If the --strictNullChecks flag is not specified, you can assign the useless to null.

useless = null; // OK if --strictNullChecks is not specified
